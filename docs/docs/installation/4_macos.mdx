# MacOS

<Note>
    The preferred method of installation method is using Docker.
</Note>

1. Download the zip file from [releases](https://github.com/flmorg/cleanuperr/releases).
2. Extract the zip file into `/example/directory`.
3. Edit **appsettings.json**. The paths from this json file correspond with the docker env vars, as described [here](/docs/category/configuration).
4. Open a terminal and execute these commands:
    ```
    cd /example/directory
    chmod +x cleanuperr
    ./cleanuperr
    ```

<Important>
Some people have experienced problems when trying to execute cleanuperr on MacOS because the system actively blocked the file for not being signed.
As per [this comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77907937), you may need to also execute this command:
```
codesign --sign - --force --preserve-metadata=entitlements,requirements,flags,runtime /example/directory/cleanuperr
```
