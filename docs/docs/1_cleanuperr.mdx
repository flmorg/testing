# Cleanuperr

Cleanuperr is a tool for automating the cleanup of unwanted or blocked files in Sonarr, Radarr, and supported download clients like qBittorrent. It removes incomplete or blocked downloads, updates queues, and enforces blacklists or whitelists to manage file selection. After removing blocked content, cleanuperr can also trigger a search to replace the deleted shows/movies.

Cleanuperr was created primarily to address malicious files, such as `*.lnk` or `*.zipx`, that were getting stuck in Sonarr/Radarr and required manual intervention. Some of the reddit posts that made cleanuperr come to life can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonarr/comments/1gqnx16/psa_sonarr_downloaded_a_virus/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonarr/comments/1gqwklr/sonar_downloaded_a_mkv_file_which_looked_like_a/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonarr/comments/1gpw2wa/downloaded_waiting_to_import/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonarr/comments/1gpi344/downloads_not_importing_no_files_found/).

<Warning>
Because this tool is actively developed and still a work in progress, using the `latest` Docker tag may result in breaking changes.

## Naming choice

I've had people asking why it's `cleanuperr` and not `cleanuparr` and that I should change it. This name was intentional.

I've seen a few discussions on this type of naming and I've decided that I didn't deserve the `arr` moniker since `cleanuperr` is not a fork of `NZB.Drone` and it does not have any affiliation with the arrs. I still wanted to keep the naming style close enough though, to suggest a correlation between them.
