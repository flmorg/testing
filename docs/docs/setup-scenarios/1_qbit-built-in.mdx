# Using qBit's built-in blacklist (torrent)

1. Go to qBittorrent -> Options -> Downloads -> make sure `Excluded file names` is checked -> Paste an exclusion list that you have copied.
   - [blacklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flmorg/cleanuperr/refs/heads/main/blacklist), or
   - [permissive blacklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flmorg/cleanuperr/refs/heads/main/blacklist_permissive), or
   - create your own
2. qBittorrent will block files from being downloaded. In the case of malicious content, **nothing is downloaded and the torrent is marked as complete**.
3. Start **cleanuperr** with `QUEUECLEANER__ENABLED` set to `true`.
4. The **Queue Cleaner** will perform a cleanup process as described in the [How it works](/docs/how_it_works) section.

<Note>
    This scenario is an example for blocking malicious files. Other features can be included here by configuring the environment variables.
